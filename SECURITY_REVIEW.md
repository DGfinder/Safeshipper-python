# SafeShipper Platform Security Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

This security assessment examines the enterprise features implemented in the SafeShipper platform, focusing on audit systems, document generation, public tracking, and general security practices. The platform demonstrates strong security foundations with comprehensive role-based access controls, audit logging, and secure document handling. However, several areas require attention to strengthen the overall security posture.

## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. Audit System Security Assessment

#### **Strengths:**

**Comprehensive Audit Coverage:**
- Well-designed audit models (`AuditLog`, `ShipmentAuditLog`, `ComplianceAuditLog`) capture extensive activity data
- Automatic capture of user context, IP addresses, user agents, and session keys
- Proper separation of concerns with specialized audit logs for different business domains

**Access Controls:**
- Strong role-based filtering in `AuditLogListView` - only admins and compliance officers see all logs
- Regular users restricted to their own audit entries
- Shipment-specific audit logs properly filtered by user permissions

**Data Integrity:**
- Use of UUIDs for audit log IDs prevents enumeration attacks
- Immutable audit trail design with `SET_NULL` for user deletion
- Thread-local storage for request context prevents cross-request contamination

#### **Security Concerns:**

**Sensitive Data Exposure in Audit Logs:**
```python
# In audits/models.py - Lines 78-89
old_values = models.JSONField(null=True, blank=True)
new_values = models.JSONField(null=True, blank=True)
```
- **Risk:** Audit logs store complete old/new values in JSON fields without filtering
- **Impact:** Could capture sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or PII
- **Recommendation:** Implement field filtering in `serialize_for_audit()` to exclude sensitive fields

**Potential Information Leakage:**
```python
# In audits/api_views.py - Lines 40-46
def filter_search(self, queryset, name, value):
    return queryset.filter(
        Q(action_description__icontains=value) |
        Q(user__username__icontains=value) |
        Q(user__email__icontains=value) |  # Email search could leak user info
        Q(user_role__icontains=value)
    )
```
- **Risk:** Search function allows querying by user emails
- **Recommendation:** Restrict email searches to admin users only

### 2. Document Generation Security Assessment

#### **Strengths:**

**Secure PDF Generation:**
- Use of WeasyPrint library which is actively maintained and secure
- Proper error handling and logging throughout the generation process
- Clean separation of data preparation and PDF rendering

**Template Security:**
- Django templates with automatic XSS protection
- No dynamic template paths that could lead to directory traversal

#### **Security Concerns:**

**Template Injection Potential:**
```python
# In documents/pdf_generators.py - Lines 456, 531
html_content = render_to_string(f'documents/pdf/{template_name}', context)
```
- **Risk:** If `template_name` is user-controlled, could lead to template injection
- **Recommendation:** Validate template names against a whitelist

**Audit Trail Access Control:**
```python
# In documents/pdf_generators.py - Lines 257-261
if include_audit_trail:
    audit_logs = ShipmentAuditLog.objects.filter(
        shipment=shipment
    ).select_related('audit_log', 'audit_log__user').order_by('-audit_log__timestamp')[:20]
```
- **Risk:** Audit trails included in PDFs without additional permission checks
- **Recommendation:** Verify user has appropriate permissions before including audit data

### 3. Document API Security Assessment

#### **Strengths:**

**Robust Permission Checks:**
- Proper shipment access validation in `_can_access_shipment()`
- Role-based filtering in `get_queryset()`
- File size and type validation (implied by serializers)

**Secure File Handling:**
- Asynchronous processing prevents blocking attacks
- Proper error handling for failed uploads

#### **Security Concerns:**

**Insufficient File Validation:**
- Missing explicit file type validation in upload endpoints
- No malware scanning or content validation
- **Recommendation:** Implement file type whitelisting and content scanning

### 4. Shipment API Document Generation Security

#### **Strengths:**

**Strong Authorization:**
- Multiple permission checks based on user roles
- Proper content-type headers and file disposition
- Comprehensive audit logging for document generation

#### **Security Concerns:**

**Batch Document Generation:**
```python
# In shipments/api_views.py - Lines 589-591
batch_generator = BatchReportGenerator()
reports = batch_generator.generate_batch_reports([shipment], document_types)
```
- **Risk:** No rate limiting on batch operations
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting and size restrictions

### 5. Public Tracking Security Assessment

#### **Strengths:**

**Data Minimization:**
- Only customer-safe information exposed in public endpoints
- Vehicle registration numbers truncated to last 4 digits
- Driver information limited to first names only

**Proper Status Validation:**
- Document access restricted by validation status
- Delivery information only shown for completed shipments

#### **Security Concerns:**

**Tracking Number Enumeration:**
```python
# In tracking/api_views.py - Lines 344-354
shipment = Shipment.objects.select_related(
    'assigned_vehicle', 'assigned_vehicle__assigned_driver', 'customer'
).get(tracking_number=tracking_number)
```
- **Risk:** No rate limiting on tracking endpoint allows enumeration
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting and consider CAPTCHA for repeated failures

**Information Disclosure:**
```python
# In tracking/api_views.py - Lines 463-469
if vehicle.current_location and location_is_fresh:
    response_data['vehicle_location'] = {
        'latitude': vehicle.current_location['lat'],
        'longitude': vehicle.current_location['lng'],
        'last_updated': vehicle.last_reported_at.isoformat(),
        'is_fresh': location_is_fresh
    }
```
- **Risk:** Exact GPS coordinates exposed publicly
- **Recommendation:** Implement location fuzzing or geofencing for public access

### 6. General Security Assessment

#### **Configuration Security:**

**Positive Findings:**
- Proper use of environment variables for secrets
- Strong security headers configuration
- Appropriate CORS settings
- JWT token rotation enabled

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Debug mode configuration should be more explicit about production safety
- Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Session security could be enhanced

#### **Dependency Security:**

**Analysis of `requirements.txt`:**
- Most dependencies are recent versions
- Critical security libraries (cryptography, PyJWT) are up to date
- WeasyPrint and related PDF libraries are current

**Recommendations:**
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Consider pinning more specific versions
- Implement automated security updates

## Critical Vulnerabilities Identified
