# Real-time Compliance Monitoring with GPS-based Verification

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive real-time compliance monitoring system that provides GPS-based verification for dangerous goods transport according to ADG Code 7.9 requirements. This system offers continuous monitoring, automated compliance checking, and immediate alert generation for dangerous goods transport violations.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Compliance Zone Management (`ComplianceZone` Model)

**Geographic Compliance Enforcement:**
- **Zone Types**: Restricted, Prohibited, School Zones, Tunnels, Bridges, Emergency Services Areas
- **Hazard Class Restrictions**: Per-zone restrictions for specific dangerous goods classes
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Different rules for different times of day/week
- **Speed Limits**: Zone-specific maximum speeds for dangerous goods vehicles
- **Special Requirements**: Escort requirements, authority notifications

**Australian State Integration:**
- Support for all Australian states and territories
- State-specific regulatory authorities
- Local government compliance requirements

### 2. Real-time Monitoring Sessions (`ComplianceMonitoringSession` Model)

**Session Management:**
- **Active Monitoring**: Continuous GPS tracking and compliance validation
- **Compliance Scoring**: Real-time calculation of compliance percentage (0-100%)
- **Status Levels**: Compliant, Warning, Violation, Critical
- **Route Tracking**: Planned vs actual route comparison
- **Hazard Class Monitoring**: Multi-class dangerous goods support

**Performance Metrics:**
- Total violations and warnings count
- Compliance score with automatic updates
- GPS update frequency monitoring
- Alert generation and escalation

### 3. Compliance Event System (`ComplianceEvent` Model)

**Event Types:**
- **GPS Updates**: Location tracking with timestamp verification
- **Speed Violations**: Exceeding speed limits (warning at 90%, violation at 110%)
- **Zone Violations**: Entry into restricted/prohibited areas
- **Route Deviations**: Distance from planned route (warning at 500m, violation at 1000m)
- **System Alerts**: Communication loss, equipment failures
- **Emergency Events**: Incident reports, emergency stops

**Event Management:**
- **Severity Levels**: Info, Warning, Violation, Critical, Emergency
- **Acknowledgment Workflow**: Driver and fleet manager acknowledgment
- **Resolution Tracking**: Time to resolve issues
- **Automated Actions**: System-triggered responses

### 4. Alert and Notification System (`ComplianceAlert` Model)

**Multi-channel Alerts:**
- **Push Notifications**: Immediate driver alerts
- **SMS Alerts**: Critical violation notifications
- **Email Alerts**: Management notifications
- **Dashboard Alerts**: Real-time fleet monitoring
- **Webhook Integration**: External system notifications

**Delivery Tracking:**
- Send/delivery/acknowledgment timestamps
- Retry logic for failed deliveries
- Response tracking and error handling

### 5. Real-time Monitoring Service (`RealTimeComplianceMonitor`)

**Core Monitoring Functions:**
```python
# Start monitoring session
session = monitor.start_monitoring_session(shipment, vehicle, driver)

# Process GPS updates
result = monitor.process_gps_update(session, latitude, longitude, speed_kmh)

# Complete session with summary
summary = monitor.complete_monitoring_session(session, "Delivery completed")
```

**Compliance Checks:**
- **Speed Compliance**: Against zone-specific and dangerous goods speed limits
- **Zone Compliance**: Real-time geofencing with prohibited/restricted area detection
- **Route Compliance**: Deviation monitoring from planned routes
- **GPS Frequency**: Communication loss detection (5-minute threshold)

### 6. Compliance Zone Manager (`ComplianceZoneManager`)

**Geographic Services:**
```python
# Check location restrictions
restrictions = zone_manager.check_location_restrictions(location, hazard_classes)

# Generate safe routes (integration ready)
safe_route = zone_manager.get_safe_route(start_point, end_point, hazard_classes)
```

    session=session,
    latitude=-33.8688,
    longitude=151.2093,
    speed_kmh=75,
    timestamp=timezone.now()
)

# Result includes compliance checks
print(f"Violations: {result['compliance_results']['violations']}")
print(f"Warnings: {result['compliance_results']['warnings']}")
```

### 3. Zone Restriction Checking
```python
from compliance.monitoring_service import ComplianceZoneManager

zone_manager = ComplianceZoneManager()

# Check if location allows Class 3 dangerous goods
location = Point(151.2093, -33.8688, srid=4326)

print(f"Prohibited zones: {restrictions['prohibited_zones']}")
```

### 4. Emergency Response
```python
# Trigger emergency response for critical violation
from compliance.api_views import EmergencyResponseView

# Critical speed violation detected
emergency_response = EmergencyResponseView()
response = emergency_response.post(request_data={
    'event_id': critical_event.id,
    'response_type': 'EMERGENCY_STOP',
    'notes': 'Vehicle exceeding 150 km/h with Class 1 explosives'
