# Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during the two refactoring tasks:

## Task 1: Refactor Frontend to Consume Live API Data Instead of Mock Data

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Created API Service Infrastructure
- **File**: `src/services/api.ts`
  - Created a centralized API service class for making authenticated requests to Django backend
  - Implemented proper error handling and response formatting
  - Added support for query parameters and different HTTP methods
  - Used environment variable for API base URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`)

#### 2. Created User API Service
- **File**: `src/services/users.ts`
  - Defined TypeScript interfaces matching Django backend models
  - Implemented all CRUD operations for users
  - Added support for filtering, searching, and pagination
  - Included proper type definitions for UserRole, UserStatus, and related data

#### 3. Created Vehicle API Service
- **File**: `src/services/vehicles.ts`
  - Defined TypeScript interfaces matching Django backend models
  - Implemented all CRUD operations for vehicles
  - Added support for filtering by type, status, depot, etc.
  - Included special endpoints for driver assignment and depot-specific queries

#### 4. Refactored Users Page
- **File**: `src/app/users/page.tsx`
  - Removed hardcoded mock data array
  - Added `useEffect` hook to fetch data from `/api/v1/users/` endpoint
  - Implemented loading and error states
  - Updated data structure to match API response format
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Updated filtering logic to work with API parameters

#### 5. Refactored Vehicles Page
- **File**: `src/app/vehicles/page.tsx`
  - Removed hardcoded mock data array
  - Added `useEffect` hook to fetch data from `/api/v1/vehicles/` endpoint
  - Implemented loading and error states
  - Updated data structure to match API response format
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Updated filtering logic to work with API parameters

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Real-time data fetching from Django API
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ Server-side filtering and searching
- ✅ Type-safe API communication
- ✅ Authentication support via Bearer tokens
- ✅ Responsive error messages and user feedback

## Task 2: Decouple Business Logic from Models into Service Functions

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Enhanced Tracking Services
- **File**: `tracking/services.py`
  - Added `calculate_visit_duration()` function to handle duration calculations
  - Enhanced `calculate_demurrage_for_visit()` function with complete business logic
  - Updated `check_geofence_entry_exit()` to use new service functions
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

#### 2. Refactored LocationVisit Model
- **File**: `tracking/models.py`
  - Simplified `duration_hours` property to use service function
  - Simplified `calculate_demurrage()` method to use service function
  - Kept `is_active` property as simple data access
  - Maintained the same public interface for backward compatibility

#### 3. Created Comprehensive Tests
- **File**: `tracking/test_services.py`
  - Added test cases for all service functions
  - Verified that model methods still work correctly
  - Tested edge cases (active visits, disabled demurrage, short stays)
  - Ensured business logic is correctly implemented

### Key Benefits Achieved:
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic moved from models to services
- ✅ **Testability**: Service functions can be tested independently
- ✅ **Reusability**: Logic can be used by multiple parts of the application
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Easier to modify business rules without touching models
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Technical Details

### API Service Architecture
```typescript
// Centralized API service with authentication
const apiService = new ApiService('http://localhost:8000/api/v1');

// Type-safe API calls
const users = await usersApi.getUsers({ role: 'driver', is_active: true });
const vehicles = await vehiclesApi.getVehicles({ status: 'available' });
```

### Service Function Architecture
```python
# Business logic moved to services
def calculate_visit_duration(visit: LocationVisit) -> Optional[float]:
    if not visit.exit_time:
        return None
    duration = visit.exit_time - visit.entry_time
    return duration.total_seconds() / 3600

def calculate_demurrage_for_visit(visit: LocationVisit) -> Optional[Dict]:
    # Complex business logic here
    pass

# Model methods now delegate to services
@property
def duration_hours(self) -> float:
    from .services import calculate_visit_duration
    return calculate_visit_duration(self)
```

## Acceptance Criteria Met

### Task 1 - Frontend API Integration:
- ✅ User Management page loads and displays data from Django API
- ✅ Vehicle Management page loads and displays data from API
- ✅ All filtering and search functionalities work with API requests
- ✅ Mock data arrays completely removed from .tsx files
- ✅ Loading and error states properly handled

### Task 2 - Business Logic Decoupling:
- ✅ Core logic for calculating visit duration moved to `tracking/services.py`
- ✅ Core logic for calculating demurrage moved to `tracking/services.py`
- ✅ LocationVisit model is leaner and focused on data representation
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved through backward compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage added

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up proper environment variables for API base URL in production
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper token management and refresh logic
3. **Error Handling**: Add more sophisticated error handling for different API error types
4. **Caching**: Consider adding client-side caching for frequently accessed data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for real-time data updates
6. **Service Layer Expansion**: Continue moving business logic from other models to services
