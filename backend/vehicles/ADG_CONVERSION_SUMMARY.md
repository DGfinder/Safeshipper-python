# ADG Code 7.9 Vehicle Safety Equipment Conversion Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted the existing ADR-based vehicle safety equipment validation system to comply with Australian Dangerous Goods (ADG) Code 7.9 requirements. This maintains all existing functionality while adapting it to Australian regulations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created ADG Compliance Validator (`vehicles/adg_safety_services.py`)

**Fire Extinguisher Requirements (ADG Code 7.9 Table 12.1):**
- Up to 3.5t GVM: 2kg minimum capacity (1 unit)
- 3.5t to 4.5t GVM: 4kg minimum capacity (1 unit)  
- 4.5t to 12t GVM: 4kg total capacity (2 units)
- Over 12t GVM: 8kg total capacity (2 units, largest â‰¥4kg)
- **Requirement: ABE type fire extinguishers (vs ADR's ABC type)**

**Equipment Requirements (ADG Code 7.9 Table 12.2):**
- All Classes: ABE Fire Extinguisher, AS 2675 First Aid Kit, Emergency Chocks, PPE, Emergency Information
- Class 1: + Non-Sparking Tools
- Class 2: + Gas Detection Equipment  
- Class 3: + Spill Absorption Material
- Class 4: + Sand for Smothering, Non-Sparking Tools
- Class 5: + Spill Absorption Material
- Class 6: + Spill Absorption Material, Eye Wash Equipment
- Class 7: + Radiation Detection Equipment
- Class 8: + Acid Spill Kit, Eye Wash Equipment, Chemical-Resistant Clothing
- Class 9: Standard equipment only

### 2. ADG-Specific Validation Logic

**Australian Standards Compliance:**
- Fire extinguishers must be ABE type (AS/NZS 1841.1)
- First aid kits must comply with AS 2675
- PPE must meet AS/NZS standards (1337, 2161)
- Eye wash equipment must meet ANSI Z358.1

**Enhanced Compliance Levels:**
- `FULLY_COMPLIANT`: No issues
- `MINOR_ISSUES`: 1-2 non-critical issues
- `MAJOR_ISSUES`: 3+ issues or accessibility problems
- `NON_COMPLIANT`: Missing equipment, expired items, or standard violations

### 3. New API Endpoints

**Vehicle ADG Compliance Check:**
```
GET /api/vehicles/{id}/adg-compliance/?adg_classes=3,8
```

**Fleet ADG Compliance Report:**
```
GET /api/vehicles/adg-fleet-report/?company_id={id}
```

**ADG Inspections Due:**
```
GET /api/vehicles/adg-inspections-due/?days_ahead=30
```

### 4. ADG Equipment Types Setup

**Management Command:**
```bash
python manage.py setup_adg_equipment
```

**Equipment Types Created:**
- Fire Extinguisher (ABE Type) - AS/NZS 1841.1
- First Aid Kit (AS 2675) - Australian Standard
- Spill Absorption Material - Classes 3, 5
- Acid Spill Kit - Class 8 Corrosives  
- Emergency Chocks - All Classes
- Personal Protective Equipment Set - AS/NZS Standards
- Eye Wash Equipment - Classes 6, 8
- Non-Sparking Tools - Classes 1, 4
- Sand for Smothering - Class 4

### 5. Enhanced Serializers

**ADGComplianceSerializer:** Structured compliance results with equipment summaries
**ADGFleetReportSerializer:** Fleet-wide compliance reporting with percentages

## Key Differences from ADR

| Aspect | ADR 2025 | ADG Code 7.9 |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Fire Extinguisher Type | ABC Type | ABE Type |
| First Aid Standard | EN Standard | AS 2675 |
| Vehicle Categories | 3.5t, 7.5t thresholds | 3.5t, 4.5t, 12t thresholds |
| Max Fire Extinguisher | 12kg total, 6kg largest | 8kg total, 4kg largest |
| Equipment Standards | European standards | Australian/ANSI standards |

## Integration Points

### Existing System Compatibility
- All existing models (`Vehicle`, `SafetyEquipmentType`, `VehicleSafetyEquipment`) remain unchanged
- ADR compliance system continues to function alongside ADG
- Existing API endpoints unchanged
- Database schema requires no modifications

### Dangerous Goods Integration
- Integrates with existing dangerous goods classification system
- Uses existing hazard class mapping (1-9)
- Compatible with placard calculation system
- Supports mixed load validation

## Usage Examples

### 1. Check Vehicle ADG Compliance
```python
from vehicles.adg_safety_services import ADGComplianceValidator

# Check compliance for Class 8 corrosives
result = ADGComplianceValidator.validate_comprehensive_adg_compliance(
    vehicle, ['8']
)

print(f"Compliant: {result['compliant']}")
print(f"Issues: {result['issues']}")
print(f"Compliance Level: {result['compliance_level']}")
```

### 2. Generate Fleet Report
```python
from vehicles.adg_safety_services import ADGSafetyEquipmentService

report = ADGSafetyEquipmentService.generate_adg_fleet_compliance_report()
print(f"ADG Compliant Vehicles: {report['adg_compliant_vehicles']}")
print(f"Australian Standards Compliance: {report['australian_standards_compliance']}")
```

### 3. Create ADG Equipment
```python
from vehicles.adg_safety_services import ADGSafetyEquipmentService

equipment = ADGSafetyEquipmentService.create_adg_compliant_equipment(
    vehicle=vehicle,
    equipment_type=fire_extinguisher_type,
    equipment_data={
        'serial_number': 'FE001',
        'capacity': '4kg',
        'location_on_vehicle': 'Driver Cabin'
    }
)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Setup ADG Equipment Types:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py setup_adg_equipment
   ```

2. **Validate Existing Fleet:**
   Use the ADG fleet report endpoint to assess current compliance

3. **Update Vehicle Equipment:**
   Replace non-compliant equipment with ADG-compliant alternatives

4. **Training:**
   Ensure staff understand differences between ADR and ADG requirements
