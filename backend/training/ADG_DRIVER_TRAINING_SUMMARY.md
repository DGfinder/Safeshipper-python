# ADG Driver Training Verification and Competency Tracking System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive ADG (Australian Dangerous Goods) driver training verification and competency tracking system that extends the existing training infrastructure. This system provides automated validation of driver qualifications for dangerous goods transport according to ADG Code 7.9 requirements.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Driver License Management (`DriverLicense` Model)

**Features:**
- Australian driver license class tracking (C, LR, MR, HR, HC, MC)
- State-based license management (NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, ACT, NT)
- Automatic status updates based on expiry dates
- Endorsements and restrictions tracking
- Validation for dangerous goods transport eligibility

**License Classes for Dangerous Goods:**
- LR (Light Rigid): Up to 8 tonnes GVM
- MR (Medium Rigid): Up to 15 tonnes GVM  
- HR (Heavy Rigid): Over 15 tonnes GVM
- HC (Heavy Combination): Articulated vehicles
- MC (Multi-Combination): Road trains

### 2. ADG Driver Certificates (`ADGDriverCertificate` Model)

**Certificate Types:**
- **BASIC_ADG**: Fundamental dangerous goods training
- **LOAD_RESTRAINT**: Proper load securing techniques
- **SECURITY_AWARENESS**: Security threat awareness
- **VEHICLE_MAINTENANCE**: DG-specific vehicle maintenance
- **EMERGENCY_RESPONSE**: Emergency incident management
- **CLASS_SPECIFIC**: Hazard class-specific training

**Features:**
- Hazard class coverage tracking (Classes 1-9)
- Certificate validity management with automatic status updates
- Integration with internal training programs
- File attachment support for certificate documentation
- Issuing authority and verification tracking

### 3. Driver Competency Profiles (`DriverCompetencyProfile` Model)

**Comprehensive Tracking:**
- Overall qualification status (Fully/Partially/Not Qualified)
- Qualified hazard classes per driver
- Experience tracking (years, loads transported)
- Medical certificate management
- Competency assessment scheduling
- Restriction and compliance management

**Status Levels:**
- `FULLY_QUALIFIED`: All requirements met
- `PARTIALLY_QUALIFIED`: Some qualifications missing/expiring
- `NOT_QUALIFIED`: Major requirements missing
- `EXPIRED_QUALIFICATIONS`: Critical certifications expired
- `PENDING_VERIFICATION`: New driver awaiting assessment

### 4. Qualification Validation Service (`DriverQualificationService`)

**Core Functions:**
- **Driver-Shipment Validation**: Validate driver qualifications for specific dangerous goods
- **Qualified Driver Discovery**: Find drivers qualified for specific hazard classes
- **Fleet Competency Reporting**: Comprehensive fleet qualification analysis
- **Real-time Compliance Monitoring**: Automatic status updates and alerts
