## 🌟 Key Technical Innovations

### **1. Intelligent Gap-Filling Algorithm**
- Systematic analysis of UN number ranges
- Hazard class assignment based on regulatory patterns
- Automated ADR data population for new entries

### **2. Advanced Segregation Engine**
```sql
-- Example: Check compatibility between two hazard classes
SELECT * FROM check_class_compatibility('3', '5.1');
-- Result: Code 2 - Separated from (Different holds/compartments)
```

### **3. Integrated Placard System**
```sql
-- Example: Get dangerous goods with complete placard information
SELECT * FROM dangerous_goods_with_placards 
WHERE un_number = '1203';
-- Returns: Complete dangerous goods + placard requirements
```

### **4. Performance Optimization**
- **20 specialized indexes** for high-speed queries
- **Batch processing capabilities** for large shipment validation
- **Optimized segregation matrix lookups** with O(1) performance
