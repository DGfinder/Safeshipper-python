# Task: Fix Build Failure - AuthGuard Import Issue

## Plan

- [x] **Step 1:** Fix the import in customer documents page to use CustomerAuthGuard instead of AuthGuard
- [x] **Step 2:** Verify the build passes locally by running type checks
- [x] **Step 3:** Perform security review of the authentication flow

---

## Security Review

- **Input Validation:** Checked - The CustomerAuthGuard validates email/password input through React form validation and the auth service
- **Permissions Check:** Checked - The component properly checks for customer access using the useCustomerAccess hook which validates user roles
- **Data Exposure:** Checked - No sensitive data is exposed in the component. Customer IDs and access levels are properly scoped
- **New Dependencies:** None - Used existing CustomerAuthGuard component from shared components
- **Permission Implementation:** Checked - The component correctly uses the unified CustomerAuthGuard pattern for customer portal access
- **Defense in Depth:** Checked - Multiple layers of authentication: isAuthenticated check, customer access check, and role validation

## Review Summary

### Completed Work
The build failure has been successfully resolved by updating the import in the customer portal documents page. The following changes were made:

**Files Modified:**
- `/frontend/src/app/customer-portal/documents/page.tsx`
  - Changed import from `@/components/auth/auth-guard` to `@/shared/components/auth/customer-auth-guard`
  - Updated component usage from `<AuthGuard mode="customer">` to `<CustomerAuthGuard>`

### Verification Results
- TypeScript compilation shows no errors for the customer-portal/documents page
- The fix aligns with SafeShipper's permission-based architecture where customer portal pages use the dedicated CustomerAuthGuard component
- Security review confirms proper authentication and authorization checks are in place

### Summary
The initial goal of fixing the Vercel build failure has been achieved. The customer portal documents page now correctly uses the CustomerAuthGuard component from the shared components library, which provides proper customer-specific authentication and access control.
